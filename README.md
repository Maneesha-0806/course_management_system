# Student Course Management and Learning Progress Tracking System

## Project Overview

The Student Course Management and Learning Progress Tracking System is a full-stack web application developed to simplify academic course enrollment, learning management, and student progress tracking. The system enables students to register, browse available courses, enroll in courses, access learning materials, monitor their learning progress, and receive real-time notifications.

The application also provides administrators with tools to manage students, courses, enrollments, learning content, and generate reports. This project demonstrates modern full-stack web development concepts, including frontend development, backend APIs, authentication, database management, real-time communication, and deployment.

# Problem Statement

Many educational institutions face challenges in managing course registration and monitoring student progress through separate or manual systems.

Students often experience difficulties in:

* Finding available courses
* Registering for courses efficiently
* Tracking learning progress
* Accessing learning materials
* Monitoring completed and pending modules

Administrators face challenges in:

* Managing course enrollments
* Updating course content
* Monitoring student performance
* Generating reports

This system addresses these issues by providing a centralized web-based platform.
